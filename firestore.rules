/**
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict security model based on user ownership and global administrative roles.
 * User-specific data (lessons) is protected, while global data (instructors, horses) is managed by admins.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * A top-level `/lessons` collection stores all lesson bookings. Each lesson document contains a `userId` field
 * to link it to the owner, enabling per-user security rules.
 * Global data like instructors, horses, and admin roles are in their own top-level collections.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin Roles: A global admin role is implemented by checking for a user's UID in the `/admins/{userId}`
 *   collection. This provides a centralized and clear way to manage administrative privileges.
 * - Lesson Security:
 *   - Admins can read and write all lessons for management purposes.
 *   - Authenticated users can create lessons for themselves (`request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid`).
 *   - Users can only read, update, or delete their own lessons (`resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid`).
 *   - Listing the entire collection is restricted to admins to prevent data leakage.
 * - Admin-Managed Collections: The /instructors and /horses collections are strictly controlled
 *   by admins, ensuring that only authorized personnel can manage business-critical information.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` field is denormalized and stored in each lesson document. This is crucial for writing
 * secure and efficient rules, as it allows direct validation of ownership without needing complex joins or queries.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The data model correctly segregates user-centric data (/lessons) from globally managed data
 * (/instructors, /horses), which allows for distinct and highly secure access controls for each collection.
